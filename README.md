# 🪔 Diwali Sales Data Analysis 📊

This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Diwali sales data using Python. The notebook includes data preprocessing, visualization, and insights generation to better understand customer behavior and sales trends during the festive season.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used contains transactional data from a Diwali sale including:
- Customer demographics (Gender, Age, Marital Status)
- Product categories
- Purchase amount
- State and city information

📌 *Note:* The dataset (`Diwali Sales Data.csv`) should be in the same directory for the notebook to run correctly.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling null values, renaming columns)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visual insights
- Gender-wise, Age-wise, State-wise, and Category-wise analysis
- Custom plots to identify buying patterns

## 📷 Sample Visualizations

- Bar plots for gender-based purchases
- Pie charts for state-wise sales distribution
- Count plots and histograms for age and marital status distribution
